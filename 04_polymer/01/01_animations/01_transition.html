<!--

The transition-property property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties.

By default, all of the properties within an element’s different states will be altered upon change. However, only the properties identified within the transition-property value will be affected by any transitions.

In the example above, the background property is identified in the transition-property value. Here the background property is the only property that will change over the duration of 1 second in a linear fashion. Any other properties included when changing an element’s state, but not included within the transition-property value, will not receive the transition behaviors as set by the transition-duration or transition-timing-function properties.

If multiple properties need to be transitioned they may be comma separated within the transition-property value. Additionally, the keyword value all may be used to transition all properties of an element.
