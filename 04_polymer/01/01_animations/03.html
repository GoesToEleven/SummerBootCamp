t is important to note, not all properties may be transitioned, only properties that have an identifiable halfway point. Colors, font sizes, and the alike may be transitioned from one value to another as they have recognizable values in-between one another. The display property, for example, may not be transitioned as it does not have any midpoint. A handful of the more popular transitional properties include the following.

background-color
