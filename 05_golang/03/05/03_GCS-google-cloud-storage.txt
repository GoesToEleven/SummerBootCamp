you get 5gb free Google Cloud Storage with appengine
-activate GCS
-- YOU NEED TO HAVE BILLING ENABLED ON YOUR APP ENGINE ACCOUNT TO GET THE FREE 5GB

-------- GENERATE NEW P12 KEY

This is the private key's password. It will not be shown again. You must present this password to use the private key.
notasecret

we can use this private key to connect to google cloud storage
but it's in the wrong format....

app engine expects a PEM and we have a p12
we have to convert .....

https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#converting-the-private-key

# Convert the key from pkcs12 to pkcs1 (PEM).
$ cat /path/to/xxxx-privatekey.p12 | openssl pkcs12 -nodes -nocerts -passin pass:notasecret | openssl rsa > /path/to/secret.pem

for example:
cat ~/Downloads/downloaded_file.p12 | openssl pkcs12 -nodes -nocerts -passin pass:notasecret | openssl rsa > ~/Downloads/secret.pem


now we can look at this file
cat ~/Downloads/secret.pem

-these credentials let your local machine connect to your bucket
-appengine doesn't need these credentials
-we create/use them so that we can develop/test on our local machine / localhost
