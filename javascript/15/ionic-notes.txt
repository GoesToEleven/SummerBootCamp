install ionic globally
ray puts on his desktop
you already need to have:
-nodejs installed
-git
-ruby if you're using sass
here's the command at the terminal:
sudo npm install -g cordova ionic

now create a folder where you'd like to store your new project
navigate into this folder
then at the terminal:

do this:
ionic start myApp blank
or this:
ionic start myApp tabs
or this:
ionic start myApp link-to-github-repo-with-ionic-app

the myApp folder will be created
a bunch of folders will be created in the myApp folder

now you can run these commands at the terminal from the myApp folder
ionic serve
ionic serve -l

now you can open myApp/www/index.html and edit it

in index.html
play with adding stuff like this

between these tags
      <ion-content>
      </ion-content>
add a paragraph with lorem ipsum

you can go to
http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/
and add in code from there between the ion-content tags

for example
Use the ion-header-bar
Change color (bar-positive)
Create a subheader (bar-subheader)
like this:
<ion-header-bar class="bar-positive">
  <h1 class="title">Blank Starter</h1>
</ion-header-bar>
<div class="bar bar-subheader">
  <h2 class="title">Sub Header</h2>
</div>
