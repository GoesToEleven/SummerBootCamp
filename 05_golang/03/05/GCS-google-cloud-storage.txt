CREDENTIALS

downloads file
save that file
it's a json file
we need the p12
this is a way of storing a key
the password is not a secret

we can use this private key to connect to google cloud storage
but it's in the wrong format....

app engine expects a PEM and we have a p12
we have to convert .....

cat something.p12 | openssl pkcs12 -nodes -nocerts -passin pass:notasecret | openssl rsa > ~/gcs.pem

now we can look at this file
cat ~/gcs.pem

these credentials let your local machine connect to your bucket
appengine doesn't need these credentials
we create/use them so that we can develop/test on our local machine / localhost
