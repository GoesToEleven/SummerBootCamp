install ionic globally
ray puts on his desktop
you already need to have:
-nodejs installed
-git
-ruby if you're using sass
here's the command at the terminal:
sudo npm install -g cordova ionic

now create a folder where you'd like to store your new project
navigate into this folder
then at the terminal:

do this:
ionic start myApp blank
or this:
ionic start myApp tabs
or this:
ionic start myApp link-to-github-repo-with-ionic-app

the myApp folder will be created
a bunch of folders will be created in the myApp folder

now you can run these commands at the terminal from the myApp folder
ionic serve
ionic serve -l

now you can open myApp/www/index.html and edit it

in index.html
play with adding stuff like this

between these tags
      <ion-content>
      </ion-content>
add a paragraph with lorem ipsum

you can go to
http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/
and add in code from there between the ion-content tags
