<h2 id="one">What is the TEAS exam?</h2>

<p>The Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS) was developed to measure basic essential skills in the academic content
    area domains of Reading, Mathematics, Science, and English and Language Usage. These entry level skills were deemed
    important for nursing program applicants by a nursing program curriculum expert. Students must earn an overall score
    of 62% or higher to submit an application to the Registered Nursing and LVN to RN Program. Students who earn an
    overall score below 62% may enroll into remediation workshops within the Health Sciences Division at FCC. Students
    may call the Health Sciences Division office at (559) 244-2604 and ask to speak to Stephanie Robinson for more
    information on the remediation workshops.</p>

<h2 id="two">How much will the TEAS exam cost me?</h2>

<p>The cost of the TEAS exam at Fresno City College is approximately $45.00. Students will be asked to pay the cost of
    the exam at the time of testing by using a major credit card or debit card only. The remediation workshops offered
    within the Health Sciences Division are free of charge.</p>

<h2 id="three">What happens if I do not achieve a 62% on the TEAS V exam?</h2>

<p>Students who did not achieve a 62% or higher on the TEAS V exam may participate in the TEAS Remediation Workshops
    offered within the Health Sciences Division at FCC. Students interested in the remediation workshops can send an

<h2 id="four">What do I need to take care of children in my home?</h2>

<p>Family Child Care is the term used for child care that is provided in a home setting for three or more unrelated
    children. Family Child Care does require a license, which may be applied for through the Department of Social
    Services. A licensed family child care home may provide care for up to six children, including the provider's own
    children. Currently, family child care providers must complete 15 hours of child health and safety training. This
    requirement is fulfilled by Child Development 6, but may also be fulfilled by non-credit training offered through
    Red Cross or the American Heart Association.</p>

<h2 id="five">What education do I need to teach in a preschool center?</h2>

<p>To become a fully qualified teacher in a privately operated child development program, Title 22 Licensing requires a
    minimum of 12 units of course work in Child Development and six months of experience working in a teaching capacity
    in an early childhood program.</p>

<h2 id="six">What Can I Expect From My First Appointment? </h2>

<p>Your first appointment will last approximately one hour. Your therapist will discuss with you the reason(s) you are
    requesting psychological services. Your therapist will also ask you questions about your personal history, your
    social and intimate relationships, your educational goals, and your expectations for therapy. At the end of the
    appointment you and your therapist will decide how to best use the available resources. You may set up another
    appointment, or be referred to another resource, for example, an off-campus therapist, your physician, or community
    agency.</p>

    processing fee. After that, cancellations are subject to the entire course fee. Please note that if you don't cancel
    and don't attend, you are still responsible for payment.</p>

<h2 id="nine">What is the FAFSA?</h2>

    eligibility for not only the Pell Grant, but also used by other financial aid providers to determine eligibility for
    other financial aid such as the Cal Grant, the Board of Governor’s Fee Waiver, federally funded loans and more.</p>
